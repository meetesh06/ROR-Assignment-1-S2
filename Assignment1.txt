Object, class : 
	Object is a instance of a class, where class provides a blueprint for the object.
	example: (string)class = ("Hello")string_object
	example: (int)class = (123)string_object
Inheritance :
	It allows a class to inherit the properties of a super class, can allow a sub class to have access the methods and properties of a super class.
	ex: 

	#where Class name always is capitalized 
	class Meetesh < String 
	def initialize(str)
	 @str = str
	end
	def hello
	 puts "hello"
	end
	def self.test
	 puts "sup shady"
	end
	end

	#object methods
	Obj = Meetesh.new
	Obj.hello

	#class methods
	Meetesh.test

	#using string superclass methods
	Meetesh.inspect

Polymorphism :
	Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms
	ex: 

	# passing integers
	1 + 1 ==> 2
	# addition operator
	"1"+"1" ==> "11"
	# concatenation operator   


Encapsulation :
	It helps to bind the data and method/function together.
	making different data available or hidden across specified methods.
	different types of variables help to perform such opearations.  

Abstraction :
	It's a concept that makes emphasis on hiding the inner working object from the outside world.
	It helps to manage complex applications.
